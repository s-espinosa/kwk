* Add an `index.html` file, as well as empty files to hold your CSS and JS
* Create a new repository on GitHub
* Add a remote to your local project
* Make an initial commit with the starter code and push it to GitHub
* Make some changes, commit your code, and push it to GitHub
* If you have time, see if you can link your HTML to your CSS and JS files
    * Turn the background red
