# Code Challenge!

---

# Why?

* Warm up for the day
* Practice breaking a problem down (using pseudo-code, whiteboarding, etc.)
* Establish a routine
* Reinforce a culture of inquiry

We will provide a list of challenge prompts for you, but can also come up with your own!

# Challenge

* Create an array with a list of 6-8 names, at least 2 of them starting with the letter “S”.
* Write a function that will return an array containing only the names that start with the letter “S”.
* Extension: return an array containing only names that don’t start with “S”.
* Extension: Instead of hard-coding it to “S”, the function should take an argument with the first letter to look for.
